# Mission-to-Mars
Developed an autonomous robot for a Mars mission. This is based on the Mars-Rover from NASA's Pathfinder mission and has the following abilities: • Collision detection • Predictive obstacle detection (at a distance of a few centimeters) • Target recognition (at a distance of a few meters) The robot reacts to collisions and obstacles and also according to the type of the target. The following sensors are available for implementing the robot behavior: • Mirco switches • IR distance sensors • Remote control receiver As actuators, you use an omnidirectional platform with three motors. The mechanical construction has to be supplemented with Lego technology kits on this platform.
